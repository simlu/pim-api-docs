# Who is your App for?

## Personas

You will find below user archetypes we use to help you guide your decisions about product features, interactions, and even visual design of your connector. By designing for the archetype — whose goals and behavior patterns are well understood — you can satisfy the broader group of people represented by that archetype.

## Personas' needs

You will find below the main needs, associated to each user profile, in terms of process, documentation, actions related to your future print connector.

Let's already address 2 different needs:
1. The need to create a complete print catalog from PIM information.
2. The ability to create a PDF, a product brochure, a paper label or flyers on demand from one or more PIM products.


### Julia's needs

**For a print catalog:**

Julia needs an easy way to export her PIM data into your print solution (probably associated with software such as **Adobe InDesign** or **Adobe Illustrator**).

So she needs:

* An **easy to follow process** to define what PIM data will be managed by your print solution.

* A **friendly connector UI** to select and import PIM data into your print solution.

* A **complete documentation** on how to use your connector.

* A **documentation** about the limits in terms of PIM data your connector manages.

### Peter and/or Filips' needs

Peter and/or Filips needs a easy way to install, configure and maintain your connector.

So they need:

* If needed, an **easy to follow download/installation process:** to retrieve and install your connector.

* An **easy to follow configuration process** to set up the connection between the Akeneo PIM and your print solution as well as parameters to configure the connector. It requires documentation to explain the methodology on how to configure your connector compared to your business needs.

* A **connector UI or a configuration file to set up the connector** (PIM connection, select "print" channel, flexible filtering capabilities, …)

* An access to the **connector logs** to have all detailed technical information to investigate errors.

* A **documentation or a process** to know **how to customize** your connector compared to Julia's project (if needed). We know that each client project is specific and most of the time there will be a need to adapt your connector to particular contexts.
